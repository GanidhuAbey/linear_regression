# linear_regression
a very basic linear regression algorithm which will take data points and create a line of best fit.

# How it Works

within the main function on the code their are to lines that hold the x and y data points just fill this lines however you want to get
prediction.

# Some Notes

You need to have numpy and matplotlib installed.

For some reason the plotting feature on matplotlib makes the prediction look really incorrect (not sure why).
